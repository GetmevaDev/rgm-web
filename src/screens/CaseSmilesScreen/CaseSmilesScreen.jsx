		All Smiles Dental Spa started in 2016 in East Meadow,NY as a luxurious dental spa. All Smiles had at the time hired RGM to build their first website and achieved extraordinary success overtaking top of page results on all their most valuable keywords and phrases. 
		<br/>
		<br/>

		In late 2020, All Smiles decided to rebuild with a new high end user experience, photography and videography. There was 1 caveat - we canâ€™t lose our search engine rankings! Our experience in website migration makes this very attainable but a challenge none-the-less. 
		All Smiles Dental Spa offers something special to customers: a personal connection to patients, and it was our job to broadcast that message.
		<br/>
		<br/>

		We chose to build the websites on Strapi, a headless CMS, to provide a more powerful, more responsive and more secure experience for the user. The result was a cleaner, luxurious design and an over increase in organic search engine traffic.
